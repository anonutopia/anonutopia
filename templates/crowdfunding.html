                            <h5>Crowdfund Direct Democracy Projects in the Balkan Countries!</h5>

                            <p><a href="/apply/">Apply for citizenship</a> now and help us build direct democracy tools and services, as well as test them 
                            in the Balkan countries (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, etc.). Choosing these countries 
                            as a test field for Anonutopia’s products and services is not random – with the recent history of 
                            different social and political systems, the loss of trust in the crumbling institutions of the society, 
                            huge corruption issues and massive emigration,these areas seem like a fertile ground for developing and 
                            implementing blockchain-powered economic, social, and political innovations. Our intention is not to harm 
                            the national countries and institutions but to help them flourish instead.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>Crowdfunding is the very core of Anonutopia. We will crowdfund all our projects for building and using tools for 
                            utilizing liquid democracy in order to manage everything Anonutopia does in a decentralized manner. 
                            Crowdfunding is built into Anote and its goal is to fund developing apps that incentivize spending Anote 
                            and its crypto fiat equivalents (built-in deflation).
