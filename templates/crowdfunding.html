                            <p>Apply for citizenship right now and help us build direct democracy tools and services and test them 
                            in devastated Balkan countries (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, etc.). Our intention is not to 
                            destroy the national countries and institutions but to help them flourish instead.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>Crowdfunding is the very core of Anonutopia. We will crowdfund everything and build and use tools for 
                            utilizing liquid democracy in order to manage everything Anonutopia does in a decentralized manner. 
                            Crowdfunding is built into Anote and its goal is to fund developing apps that incentivize spending Anote 
                            and its crypto fiat equivalents (built-in deflation).
                            </p>
